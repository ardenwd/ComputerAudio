In this program I created a casset player with some cute little mechanic clicking noises for the play, stop, and rest buttons. I also manipulated a slide whistle sound for the reverse and fast forward buttons. For the look, I decided to use an image of an old walkman and I made sure to add a gain knob so that you can turn the music down if you'd like.
